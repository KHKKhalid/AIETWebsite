Alexandria Higher Institute of Engineering & Technology (AIET) is a private institute of higher education founded in 1996 and owned by "Mohamed-Ragab Foundation for Social Development" which is a non-profit organization registered under No. SR 1075 with the Egyptian Government. The motivation behind establishing this private institute is to fulfill the industry needs in Egypt for engineers well-educated and trained in modern engineering and technological fields. Engineering technology is a relatively new discipline. The programs of study at AIET are designed to meet the growing need created by the technological revolution for college-educated problem solvers who can support the engineering process by bridging the gap between the blueprints and the production line.


The AIET Institute is a co-educational where women are admitted, parallel to men, to all departments. The language of instruction is English. The main objective of the AIET Institute is to share in the education of the Egyptian youth as well as those from other countries, and in the advancement of knowledge.


The undergraduate curricula are well designed to keep up with the latest development in each particular field of study, so that the engineer will be able to make appropriate decisions based on sound engineering academic and technical principles.

   Undergraduate Programs
The Alexandria Higher Institute of Engineering & Technology (AIET) comprises four departments, namely:

1- Electronics and Communications Engineering Department, delivering the Electronics and Communications Engineering (ECE) Program;

2- Computer Engineering Department, delivering the Computer Engineering (CE) Program;

3- Mechatronics Engineering Department, delivering the Mechatronics Engineering (EME) Program; and

4- Industrial Engineering Department, delivering the Industrial Engineering (IE) Program.

Since at AIET Institute, each department is offering one program carrying its name, the two words department and program are equivalent and thus interchangeable. The program of study leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) in Engineering extends over five academic years. The Bachelor of Science programs are offered by the departments. The four programs have common preparatory year and they branch starting the first year. The three first programs, however, have many more common courses to form one common complete academic year.

The Industrial Engineering Department is common with the other three departments in the preparatory year, and it branches starting the first year.

The academic year is divided into three Terms (Semesters) (First or Fall; Second or Spring; and Third or Summer). The fall and spring terms or semesters are of seventeen weeks each, while the summer term is only eight weeks. If the two Islamic Festivals lie in the same term (semester), one extra week is added. The summer terms in the first four years of study are available to practical training in industry whether in Egypt or abroad. Selected courses by the AIET Institute may be offered in the summer term in which students can register in not more than two courses, according to the regulations of the AIET Institute Council and without contradiction with their summer training.
